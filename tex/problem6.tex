\begin{problem}[Handout]
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Consider the scalar problem
    \[
      y' = -5ty^2 + \frac{5}{t} - \frac{1}{t^2}, \qquad y(1) = 1,
    \]
    for $1 \leq t \leq 25$.
    \item Consider the problem
    \[
      y' = y \sin(2t + 3), \qquad y(0) = 1.
    \]
  \end{enumerate}
  For both cases you should be able to get the exact solution.
  
  Use the following methods to compute the numerical solution for the given problem.
  \begin{enumerate}[(i)]
    \item Forward Euler
    \item Backward Euler
    \item $\theta$-method with $\theta = \frac12$ and at least one other value.
  \end{enumerate}
  
  For each method, use different $h$ values and include a table showing the values at the end points and maximum error. Analyze the consistency, $0$-stability and convergence based on the theories learned in class.
